  <h1>Croissantü•ê</h1>
  <p>The croissant is a buttery, flaky, and delicious pastry that
  originated in Austria but is now a staple of French bakeries and cafes. 
  Known for its crescent shape, the croissant is made from a laminated dough<br/>
  that involves folding butter into the dough multiple times to create thin
  layers. This process gives the croissant its signature airy texture and
  rich flavor, making it a popular choice for breakfast or a delightful <br/>
  snack. Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with a variety of
   ingredients such as chocolate, almond paste, 
  or ham and cheese, offering a versatile treat for any time of the day.</p>
